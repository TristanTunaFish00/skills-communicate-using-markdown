## Blockquotes
> This is a Blockquote! Supposedly, it's used to highlight a specific quote and put emphasis on it. I do recall having to use blockquotes in high school to quote a long passage that held great significance to my claim and main idea.
> Adding a second blockquote symbol makes the blockquote look a little cleaner, but adds on to the previous blockquote.
> I see that it can be used to give tips and comments to whoever is reading my stuff!

## Inline Code and Code Blocks
I can be writing normally but I want to reference how to print Hello World in Python `print("Hello, World")` as you can see. I can also use triple backticks for code blocks. This makes the code color-coded, making it much easier to read and understand! 

```python
print("Hello, ZA WARUDO")
```
